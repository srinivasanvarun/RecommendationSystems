# RecommendationSystems
<p>
This repository contains python implementation of collaborative filtering recommendation systems. The following techniques are used:
<ul>
  <li>User based CF - Cosine Similarity</li>
  <li>User based CF - Pearson Correlation</li>
  <li>User based CF - Pearson Correlation with Inverse user Frequency</li>
  <li>User based CF - Pearson Correlation with Case modification</li>
  <li>Item based CF - Modified Cosine Similarity</li>
  <li>Ensemble Learning combining User based CF and Item based CF</li>
</ul>
